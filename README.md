# CS210 - Wildlife Zookeeper Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This program was designed to keep track of a few different types of animals, and also track some things about those animals. It can save data and load data stored locally on the device which the program is loaded. It can present the animal data to a user in a nicely formatted table.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
  My program has a bunch of error checking that handles inputs and prevents users from entering any input that would cause an issue for the program. It very nicely informs the user at multiple points if they enter something wrong. It also has a built in animal object that can be used and modified for other purposes down the road. If they ever needed to track more information about the animals it would be easy to add.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I wasn't able to spend much time ensuring this code is effecient. I'm sure it uses memory in some places without clearing it out when done being used. It wasn't a prominent requirement of the assignemnt. It's secure since I used mostly protected variables in the animal classes.
  
# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The most challenging part for me was trying to get all of the error checking to work. It seemed like my code doubled in size once I added all of the error checking. I ended up overcoming by finding resources outside of SNHU to help. Youtube and stack overflow have been the main sources of assistance that I've been using.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  Being able to read and write to a file is extremely important to be able to allow your program to save the work the user does. That's the most valuable thing I learned from this project was learning how to use C++ to read and write.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added a bunch of inline comments to show what each part of the program is doing. I named every variable and function to indicate what they're for. I also created a multi classs animal object that can be used for many different types of animals. This could be easily modified and used for other purposes, like a grocery list.
